# Greedy Piggy Bank readme

## How did you made this game ?
This game has been made using a premade project using JavaScript ES6 : [Right here !](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack)

#### Exploitation systems :
* [Ubuntu Gnome version 16.04](https://ubuntugnome.org/). A free OS that has a lot of advantages (if you know how to use it)
* Windows 7
* Windows 10

#### Browsers :
* [Firefox 57.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (A more optimised browser, that respects your privacy)
* [Google Chrome](www.google.fr/chrome) and it's open source sibling, [Chromium !](https://www.chromium.org/)

#### Text editors :
* [Atom](http://atom.io), the text editor developped at GitHub. Runs smoothly, supports any file format and gives a graphical interface to manage your git.

#### Server-related softwares :
* [cmder](http://cmder.net/), a software that brings the Linux Bash to Windows (worked on 7 and 10). Useful if you're used to the Linux shell.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), that's why the game works way better on Chrome and Chromium (because node.js is based on their software). More optimised that a simple Apache server.
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), to make Web games easily !

#### Other softwares :
* [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/), to make our maps using our own sprites.
* [PyxelEdit](http://pyxeledit.com/), to make our assets and animations. Non-free :/
* [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/), to make our music. Non-free too :/
* [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/), to make the sounds that required voice acting. Ugly UI but does exactly what you want it to do.
* [itch.io](http://www.itch.io), the best website to upload your indie games, especially for game jams. Perfect for experimental or __really__ indie stuff.

+ Git and GitHub obviously.
